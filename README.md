# Gary-Zhuo-Portfolio-




Welcome and thank you for taking the time to check my portfilo out,

This project represent the skill level that I am currently at, and the site changing and improving 
represents me as a SE & developer as well, always improving.


This site is made of these 3 components ,
-HTML 
-CSS
-Javascript,

The animations were made using a vareity of different keyframes and adjustments to the text boxes,

The picture carousel was implemented using JavasScript with event listeners to let the browser know that someone has 
clicked on a "next" or "previous" button.

My projects page isnt quite done yet, nor will it ever be done I suppose, 
this part of the page will be continously updated as I grow and hone my skills as a developer,

To run the games within the projects page, please make sure you download VS Code and have a accessible terminal.


Overall, I am geniunely happy with my work and I cannot wait to learn and improve and see where this journey takes me,

now come,

sit back,

relax,

have a cup of coffee and,

enjoy.

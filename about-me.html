            As I sit at my desk,</h4>

            <p id="one"> scrolling through the latest tech news and industry trends, <br />

             I can't help but feel a sense of wonder and excitement. <br />
             I'm in the midst of transitioning into the tech field, <br />
              but I don't have a traditional background <br />
              in software development, so the road ahead feels daunting. <br />

            But I'm not one to shy away from a challenge. <br />
            I'm reading everything I can get my hands on, taking online courses, <br />
            and participating in tech meetups and webinars.<br />
             I'm eager to learn as much as I can about the industry, <br />
            and to build connections with others who are passionate about tech.<br />
            
            I know that feeling lost and discouraged is a natural part of the process,<br />
             but I'm determined to keep pushing forward. <br />
             I want to use my experience to help others who are in the same boat as me. <br />
             I want to educate and empower them to make <br />
             their mark in the tech industry, no matter their background.<br />
            
            I know that success won't come overnight,<br />
             but I believe that with hard work, <br />
            dedication, and a willingness to take risks, anything is possible. <br />
            I'm excited to see where this journey takes me,<br />
             and to help others along the way.
            </p>
